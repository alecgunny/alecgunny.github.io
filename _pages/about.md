Welcome to my github.io page! I'm Alec, a data scientist, deep learning researcher, and Python enthusiast, particularly interested in the application of these skills to physics research. I love building simple, intuitive tools for taking the headache out of building scalable and deployable deep learning projects, with a particular focus on using containers and CI tools to keep practictioners focused on the much more interesting data science problems they'd rather be working on.

I also love writing about technical problems! Feel free to peruse the just-for-fun projects in the [projects](/projects) tab to see some [Jupyter Books] on whatever topic happened to cross my mind on that particular day (as well as some older projects that are in desperate need of updating).
