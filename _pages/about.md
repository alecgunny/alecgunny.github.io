Welcome to my github.io page! I'm Alec, a data scientist, deep learning researcher, and Python enthusiast, particularly interested in the application of these skills to physics research. I love building simple, intuitive tools for taking the headache out of building scalable and deployable deep learning projects, with a particular focus on using containers and CI tools to keep practictioners focused on the much more interesting data science problems they'd rather be working on.

I also love writing about technical problems! Feel free to peruse the just-for-fun projects in the [projects](/projects) for some [Jupyter Books](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) on whatever topic happened to cross my mind on that particular day (as well as some older projects that are in desperate need of updating).

My most recent professional work involves building the TensorFlow Keras integration of [NVTabular](https://github.com/nvidia/nvtabular), a library for accelerating the training of tabular neural network architectures on GPU through accelerated data-loading, preprocessing, and categorical embedding. You can find a write up on its usage, and my philosophy while building it, in [this notebook](https://github.com/nvidia/nvtabular/tree/main/examples/tensorflow/accelerating-tensorflow.ipynb).
